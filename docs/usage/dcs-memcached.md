## Deprovision

Delete the provisioned instance.

## Example on Cloud Foundry

### Provision

The following command will create a service.

```
cf create-service dcs-memcached SingleNode mymemcached -c '{
    "username": "username",
    "password": "Password1234!",
    "name": "MemcachedSingleNode",
    "description": "Memcached Single Node Test"
}'
```

You can check the status of the service instance using the `cf service` command.

```
cf service mymemcached
```

### Bind

Once the service has been successfully provisioned, you can bind to it by using
`cf bind-service` or by including it in a Cloud Foundry manifest.

```
cf bind-service myapp mymemcached
```

Use `cf restage` command to ensure your env variable changes take effect.

```
cf restage myapp
```

Once bound, you can view the environment variables for a given application using the `cf env` command.

```
cf env myapp
```

### Unbind

To unbind a service from an application, use the `cf unbind-service` command.

```
cf unbind-service myapp mymemcached
```

### Update

To update a service, use the `cf update-service` command.

```
cf update-service mymemcached -c '{
    "name": "MemcachedSingleNode1",
    "description": "Memcached Single Node Test1",
    "new_capacity": 8
}'
```

You can also check the status of the service instance using the `cf service` command.

```
cf service mymemcached
```

### Deprovision

To deprovision the service, use the `cf delete-service` command.

```
cf delete-service mymemcached
```
